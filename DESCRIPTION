Description: Functions that solve initial value problems
    of a system of first-order and higher-order ordinary and
    stochastic differential equations ('ODE' and 'SDE'),
    ordinary and stochastic partial differential equations
    ('PDE' and 'SPDE'), random differential equations ('RDE'),
    differential algebraic equations ('DAE'), delay
    differential equations ('DDE'), and others.
    The functions provide an interface to the library
    'DifferentialEquations.jl' that contains a collection
    of the classic C/FORTRAN algorithms and high-performance
    Julia implementations of more recently developed algorithms.
    A full description is given at http://docs.juliadiffeq.org.
